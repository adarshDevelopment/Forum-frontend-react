1. object-cover: this class does not stretch the image and crops it 
2. overflow-hidden: hides overflown elements 
3. focus-outline-none: removes the thick annyoing border when focusing
4. to learn about flex, open Flex.jsx
5. focus:outline-none to remove the annyoing dark borders from input

React Router setup:

1. install react router: npm install react-router-dom
2. createBrowserRouter: This function is used to create a router instance for a web application. It expects an array of route objects.
    createRoutesFromElements: This function converts JSX elements (like <Route>) into a format that createBrowserRouter can use.

    <Route> Component: Each <Route> component expects path and element props. The path prop defines the URL path, while the element prop specifies the React component to render for that path.
